        <h3>新概念3</h3>
        <p>
            We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly
            everything seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to
            go wrong at precisely the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions.
            Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone
            rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the
            baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the
            process. You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc.Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt.As if this
            were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.
            Things can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of
            Sydney. During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. The woman
            immediately behind the two cars Happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car.
            This made the driver following her brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. As she
            was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying
            through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry
            was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and onto the road.
            This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the police nearly an
            hour to get the traffic on the move again. In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of
            broken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was
            left of the cake. It was just one of those days!

            African music is increasingly popular on the internet and on smartphones in places far outside of Africa.
            Companies are noticing a worldwide interest in African music. The company Universal Music Group launched
            Virgin Music Africa Label & Artist Services in June. It aims to support independent African music recording
            companies, often called labels, and artists. The service will digitize music catalogues, or collections of
            songs coming from the same owner, that are no longer available to buyers. The company aims to expand into
            the growing market for African sounds. The interest from international companies is growing as African
            artists become the main performers at international music events like festivals and concerts. Festivals
            include Afro Nation in Portugal and Africolor in France. African musical forms such as Afrobeat, Rhumba, and
            Amapiano are topping popular music lists, known as charts.
